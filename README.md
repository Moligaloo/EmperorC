EmperorC
========

A serial of tools to analyse, debug and profile C source code


Currently work:
  * c2ast: parsing C source code into abstract syntax tree (AST)
  
Roadmap:
  * ast2il: convert abstract syntax tree to intermediate language
  * emperor_run: run intermediate code in a trusted environment
